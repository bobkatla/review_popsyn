	abstract = {Micro-simulation travel demand and land use models require a synthetic population, which consists of a set of agents characterized by demographic and socio-economic attributes. Two main families of population synthesis techniques can be distinguished: (a) fitting methods (iterative proportional fitting, updating) and (b) combinatorial optimization methods. During the last few years, a third outperforming family of population synthesis procedures has emerged, i.e., Markov process-based methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations. In this paper, an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach is presented, which can serve as a better alternative than the existing methods. The approach is characterized by a great flexibility and efficiency in terms of data preparation and model training. The HMM is able to reproduce the structural configuration of a given population from an unlimited number of micro-samples and a marginal distribution. Only one marginal distribution of the considered population can be used as a boundary condition to "guide" the synthesis of the whole population. Model training and testing are performed using the Survey on the Workforce of 2013 and the Belgian National Household Travel Survey of 2010. Results indicate that the HMM method captures the complete heterogeneity of the micro-data contrary to standard fitting approaches. The method provides accurate results as it is able to reproduce the marginal distributions and their corresponding multivariate joint distributions with an acceptable error rate (i.e., SRSME=0.54 for 6 synthesized attributes). Furthermore, the HMM outperforms IPF for small sample sizes, even though the amount of input data is less than that for IPF. Finally, simulations show that the HMM can merge information provided by multiple data sources to allow good population estimates.},

	abstract = {Synthetic population is a key input to agent-based urban/transportation microsimulation models. The objective of population synthesis is to reproduce the underlying statistical properties of real population based on available microsamples and marginal distributions. However, characterizing the joint associations among a large set of attributes is challenging because of the curse of dimensionality, in particular when attributes are organized in a hierarchical household-individual structure. In this paper, we use a hierarchical mixture model to characterize the joint distribution of both household and individual attributes. Based on this model, we propose a framework of generating representative household structures in population synthesis. The framework integrates three models: (1) probabilistic tensor factorization, (2) multilevel latent class model, and (3) rejection sampling. With this framework, one can generalize not only the associations of within- and cross-level attributes, but also reproduce structural relationships among household members (e.g., husband-wife). As a case study, we implement this framework based on the household interview travel survey (HITS) data of Singapore, and then use the inferred model to generate a synthetic population pool. This model demonstrates great potential in reproducing the underlying statistical distribution of real population. The generated synthetic population can serve as a replacement for census in developing agent-based models, with privacy and confidentiality being protected and preserved.},

	abstract = {Microsimulation of urban systems evolution requires synthetic population as a key input. Currently, the focus is on treating synthesis as a fitting problem and thus various techniques have been developed, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Combinatorial Optimization based techniques. The key shortcomings of these procedures include: (a) fitting of one contingency table, while there may be other solutions matching the available data (b) due to cloning rather than true synthesis of the population, losing the heterogeneity that may not have been captured in the microdata (c) over reliance on the accuracy of the data to determine the cloning weights (d) poor scalability with respect to the increase in number of attributes of the synthesized agents. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation based approach. Partial views of the joint distribution of agent's attributes that are available from various data sources can be used to simulate draws from the original distribution. The real population from Swiss census is used to compare the performance of simulation based synthesis with the standard IPF. The standard root mean square error statistics indicated that even the worst case simulation based synthesis (SRMSE = 0.35) outperformed the best case IPF synthesis (SRMSE = 0.64). We also used this methodology to generate the synthetic population for Brussels, Belgium where the data availability was highly limited.},

However, due to its high-dimensionality, even if anonymised there still exists the possibility to re-identify the users behind the mobile phone traces. This risk makes its usage outside the telecommunication network incompatible with recent data privacy regulations, hampering its adoption in transportation-related applications. To address this issue, we propose a framework designed only with user-aggregated mobile phone data to synthesise realistic daily individual mobility — Digital Twin Travellers. We explore different strategies built around modified Markov models and an adaption of the Rejection Sampling algorithm to recreate realistic daily schedules and locations. We also define a one-day mobility population score to measure the similarity between the population of generated agents and the real mobile phone user population. Ultimately, we show how with a series of histograms provided by the telecommunication service provider (TSP) it is possible and plausible to disaggregate them into new synthetic and useful individual-level information, building in this way a big data travel demand framework that is designed in accordance with current data privacy regulations.},

This paper introduces a new alternative for population synthesis based on Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution, encoding probabilistic relationships among a set of variables in an efficient way. Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efficient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and confidentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overfitting of data can be avoided as much as possible.},

	abstract = {Large scale activity-based simulation models inform a variety of transportation and planning policies using models that often rely on fixed or flexible workplace location in a synthetic population as input to work related activity, participation, and subsequent destination dependent travel decisions. Although discrete choice models can estimate workplace location with greater flexibility, disaggregate data available (e.g., travel surveys) are often too sparse to estimate workplace location at sufficient spatial detail. Alternatively, aggregated employment data are often readily available at higher spatial resolutions, but are typically only used in separately estimated ad hoc models, which introduces error if the estimations have divergent solutions. This paper’s primary contribution is to reduce error by integrating population synthesis and workplace assignment, yielding a synthetic population with home and work locations included as attributes. The two are integrated using additional variables shared between population and workplace assignment (i.e., industry sector), but this increased matrix size can render conventional multilevel person-household re-weighting methods computational intractable. A secondary contribution is to mitigate this scalability challenge using more efficient optimization-based re-weighting approaches, substantially reducing computation time. The proposed process is applied to the Greater Boston Area, generating a population of 4.6-million persons within 1.7-million households across 965 census tract zones. The integrated process is compared against conventional ad hoc location assignment process, using both classical and contemporary synthesis techniques of Iterative Proportional Fitting, Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, and Bayesian Network simulation. The integrated approach yielded an improvement in workplace location assignment, with only modest impact on population accuracy.},

In this regard, we propose an integrated approach including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and profiling-based methods to capture the behavioral complexity and the great heterogeneity of agents of the true population through representative micro-samples. The population synthesis method is capable of building the joint distribution of a given population with its corresponding marginal distributions using either full or partial conditional probabilities or both of them simultaneously. In particular, the estimation of socio-demographic or transport-related variables and the characterization of daily activity-travel patterns are included within the framework. The fully probabilistic structure based on Markov Chains characterizing this framework makes it innovative compared to standard activity-based models. Moreover, data stemming from the 2010 Belgian Household Daily Travel Survey (BELDAM) are used to calibrate the modeling framework. We illustrate that this framework effectively captures the behavioral heterogeneity of travelers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is adequately adapted to meeting the demand for large-scale micro-simulation scenarios of transportation and urban systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm that follows the sample-free approach to synthesise a population for agent based modelling purposes. While most existing algorithms rely on a sample dataset, the fact that this algorithm does not rely on one makes it a novel contribution. It has potentially widespread application for situations in which such survey data is not available. In contrast to existing sample-free algorithms, the population synthesis presented in this paper applies the heuristics to part of the allocation of synthetic individuals into synthetic households. As a result the iterative process which does this and which is normally the most computationally demanding and time consuming process, is required only for a subset of synthetic individuals. This means that the population synthesiser in this work is computationally efficient enough for practical application to build a large synthetic population (many millions) for many thousands target areas at the smallest possible geographical level. This capability ensures that the geographical heterogeneity of the resulting synthetic population is preserved. The paper presents the application of the new method to synthesise the population for New South Wales in Australia in 2006. The resulting total synthetic population has approximately 6 million people living in over 2.3 million households residing in private dwellings across over 11,000 census collection districts (CCDs). Analyses show evidence that the synthetic population matches very well with the census data across seven demographic attributes that characterise the population at both household level and individual level.

	abstract = {Population microdata comprise a list of households and individuals, each with an associated list of characteristics. Unfortunately, for Britain no small-area microdata exist that offer the broad range of demographic and socio-economic variables contained in the national census. There are a number of approaches to the reconstruction of such spatially detailed microdata, including data fusion, synthetic reconstruction (chain imputation) and reweighting. One variant of the reweighting approach involves the selection of a combination of households from the 1\% household SAR that best fits known small-area constraints (the published census tabulations). In this paper the implementation of this 'combinatorial optimisation' technique is more thoroughly examined. First the combinatorial optimisation process is reviewed. Then a number of methodological innovations, designed to improve the accuracy and consistency of resulting outputs, are reported. Subsequently the problems of evaluating the outputs are discussed and a new strategy is outlined for assessing the quality of synthetic microdata. The strategy proposed is generally applicable to all such data, irrespective of their means of generation. The paper goes on to provide an extensive assessment of the quality of synthetic microdata produced using the combinatorial optimisation approach. This represents the first time that such an evaluation has ever been undertaken. The results highlight the degree to which such data may be able to meet specific user needs. The paper concludes by offering an illustration of the 'added value' that can be obtained by combining information from public-use microdata with published small-area tabulations.

	abstract = {The advent of microsimulation approaches in travel demand modeling, wherein activity-travel patterns of individual travelers are simulated in time and space, has motivated the development of synthetic population generators. These generators typically use census-based marginal distributions on household attributes to generate joint distributions on variables of interest using standard iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedures. Households are then randomly drawn from an available sample in accordance with the joint distribution such that household-level attributes are matched perfectly. However, these traditional procedures do not control for person-level attributes and joint distributions of personal characteristics. In this paper, a heuristic approach, called the Iterative Proportional Updating (IPU) algorithm, is presented to generate synthetic populations whereby both household-level and person-level characteristics of interest can be matched in a computationally efficient manner. The algorithm involves iteratively adjusting and reallocating weights among households of a certain type (cell in the joint distribution) until both household and person-level attributes are matched. The algorithm is illustrated with a small example, and then demonstrated in the context of a real-world application using small geographies (blockgroups) in the Maricopa County of Arizona in the United States. The algorithm is found to perform very well, both from the standpoint of matching household and person-level distributions and computation time. It appears that the proposed algorithm holds promise to serve as a practical population synthesis procedure in the context of activity-based microsimulation modeling.},

To date, research based on such simulations is rarely replicable as it is based on proprietary data and tools. To foster the discussion and steer research towards reproducible transport simulations, this paper introduces a process for generating a synthetic travel demand with individual households, persons, and their daily activity chains for Paris and its surrounding region Île-de-France — entirely based on open data and open software and replicable by any researcher. The resulting travel demand is published for others to use as a comprehensive data basis for agent-based transport simulations and as a test bed for population and demand synthesis algorithms. Furthermore, it is discussed how implicit correlation structures impact the potential use cases of the synthetic travel demand for simulation and analysis purposes and how the common practice of using population samples for downstream simulations affects the results.},

	abstract = {In urban and transportation research, important information is often scattered over a wide variety of independent datasets which vary in terms of described variables and sampling rates. As activity-travel behavior of people depends particularly on socio-demographics and transport/urban-related variables, there is an increasing need for advanced methods to merge information provided by multiple urban/transport household surveys. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and an Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to obtain quasi-perfect marginal distributions and accurate multi-variate joint distributions. The model allows for the combination of an unlimited number of datasets. The model is validated on the basis of a synthetic dataset with 1,000,000 observations and 8 categorical variables. The results reveal that the hierarchical model is particularly robust as the deviation between the simulated and observed multivariate joint distributions is extremely small and constant, regardless of the sampling rates and the composition of the datasets in terms of variables included in those datasets. Besides, the presented methodological framework allows for an intelligent merging of multiple data sources. Furthermore, heterogeneity is smoothly incorporated into micro-samples with small sampling rates subjected to potential sampling bias. These aspects are handled simultaneously to build a generalized probabilistic structure from which new observations can be inferred. A major impact in term of expert systems is that the outputs of the hierarchical model (HM) model serve as a basis for a qualitative and quantitative analyses of integrated datasets.},

Algorithms for calculating these two types of constraints are established through thorough theoretical proof. Comparative experiments have been undertaken with state-of-the-art algorithms. It has been demonstrated that an algorithm improved with the proposed ancestral partition or combined ancestral and heuristic partition outperforms the algorithm in its original form, and it can have lower running time, fewer expanded states, and higher accuracy, as well as the ability to search larger networks within 100 nodes.},

This approach assumes that each local score can be computed fast, which can be problematic when the scarcity of the data calls for structured local models or when there are both continuous and discrete variables, for these cases have lacked efficient-to-compute local scores. To address this challenge, we introduce a local score that is based on a class of classification and regression trees. We show that under modest restrictions on the possible branchings in the tree structure, it is feasible to find a structure that maximizes a Bayes score in a range of moderate-size problem instances. In particular, this enables global optimization of the Bayesian network structure, including the local structure. In addition, we introduce a related model class that extends ordinary conditional probability tables to continuous variables by employing an adaptive discretization approach. The two model classes are compared empirically by learning Bayesian networks from benchmark real-world and synthetic data sets. We discuss the relative strengths of the model classes in terms of their structure learning capability, predictive performance, and running time.},

	abstract = {Learning Bayesian networks is often cast a� an optimization problem, where the computational ta�k is to find a structure that maximizes a sta­ tistically motivated score. By and large, existing learning tools address this optimization problem using standard heuristic search techniques. Since the search space is extremely large, such search procedures can spend most of the time examining candidates that are extremely unrea�onable. This problem becomes critical when we deal with data sets that are large either in the number of in­ stance.�. or the number of attributes. In this paper. we introduce an algorithm that achieves fa�ter learning by restricting the search space. This iterative algorithm restricts the par­ ents of each variable to belong to a small sub­ set of candidates. We then search for a network that satisfies these constraints. The learned net­ work is then used for selecting better candidates for the next iteration. We evaluate this algorithm both on synthetic and real-life data. Our results show that it is significantly faster than alternative search procedures without loss of quality in the learned structures.},

	abstract = {Structure learning of Bayesian networks has always been a challenging problem. Nowadays, massive-size networks with thousands or more of nodes but fewer samples frequently appear in many areas. We develop a divide-and-conquer framework, called partition-estimation-fusion (PEF), for structure learning of such big networks. The proposed method first partitions nodes into clusters, then learns a subgraph on each cluster of nodes, and finally fuses all learned subgraphs into one Bayesian network. The PEF method is designed in a flexible way so that any structure learning method may be used in the second step to learn a subgraph structure as either a DAG or a CPDAG. In the clustering step, we adapt hierarchical clustering to automatically choose a proper number of clusters. In the fusion step, we propose a novel hybrid method that sequentially adds edges between subgraphs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our PEF method, in terms of both speed and accuracy compared to existing methods. Our method can improve the accuracy of structure learning by 20\% or more, while reducing running time up to two orders-of-magnitude.},

The majority of this work has concentrated on using decision-tree representations for the CPDs. In addition, researchers typically apply non-Bayesian (or asymptotically Bayesian) scoring functions such as MDL to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of networks to the data. In this paper we investigate a Bayesian approach to learning Bayesian networks that contain the more general decision-graph representations of the CPDs. First, we describe how to evaluate the posterior probability-that is, the Bayesian score-of such a network , given a database of observed cases. Second, we describe various search spaces that can be used, in conjunction with a scoring function and a search procedure, to identify one or more high-scoring networks. Finally , we present an experimental evaluation of the search spaces, using a greedy algorithm and a Bayesian scoring function.},

Informative prior information is needed in order to assign appropriate weights to each network in this set if synthetic data are to have both good inferential properties and an acceptable risk of disclosure.

	abstract = {A Bayesian optimization algorithm for the nurse scheduling problem is presented, which involves choosing a suitable scheduling rule from a set for each nurse's assignment. Unlike our previous work that used GAs to implement implicit learning, the learning in the proposed algorithm is explicit, i.e. eventually, we will be able to identify and mix building blocks directly. The Bayesian optimization algorithm is applied to implement such explicit learning by building a Bayesian network of the joint distribution of solutions. The conditional probability of each variable in the network is computed according to an initial set of promising solutions. Subsequently, each new instance for each variable is generated by using the corresponding conditional probabilities, until all variables have been generated, i.e. in our case, a new rule string has been obtained. Another set of rule strings will be generated in this way, some of which will replace previous strings based on fitness selection. If stopping conditions are not met, the conditional probabilities for all nodes in the Bayesian network are updated again using the current set of promising rule strings. Computational results from 52 real data instances demonstrate the success of this approach. It is also suggested that the learning mechanism in the proposed approach might be suitable for other scheduling problems. © 2003 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Population synthesis is concerned with the generation of synthetic yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transportation where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to ‘grow’ pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.},

To date, the conventional approach to synthesizing the base-year population has been based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Two issues associated with this conventional approach are discussed: the first is often termed as the zero-cellvalue problem, and the second is related to the inability to control for statistical distributions of both household- and individual-level attributes. Then, a new population synthesis procedure is presented that addresses the limitations of the conventional approach. The new procedure is implemented into an operational software system and used to generate synthetic populations for the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. Validation results indicate that the new procedure can produce a synthetic population that more closely represents the true population than the conventional approach can.},

	abstract = {Population synthesis is extensively required by a number of micro-simulation models in transportation. A heuristic-based population synthesis method called Pop-H was proposed to overcome the following two limitations that received less attention. The first limitation is that one target marginal distribution can be well met by various sets of household weights that can be used to generate different sets of population and thus it is a problem that which set of household weights is the real one. Secondly, the population synthesis is commonly viewed as an optimization problem, and minimizing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error of control variables is generally used as the objective function. The Standard Deviation of control variables is also crucial in some cases, which, however receives scant attention. In response to these two limitations, the heuristic-based population synthesis method works in the following way: the Pop-H algorithm starts with the initial set of household weights derived from a sample data and calculates the final set of household weights by iteratively adjusting the initial set in a defined way with the objective function taking into account both Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Standard Deviation of control variables. Finally, the medium-sized city of Baoding, China was used as the case study. The sensitivity test was firstly done to examine four key parameters of the Pop-H algorithm, and then the algorithm was applied to create the population for the whole city.},

	abstract = {Microsimulation models that simulate travel demand at the level of individual travelers have been gaining increasing interest among practitioners. Transportation planning agencies across the country are steadily migrating to activity-based microsimulation models, which provide considerable flexibility when testing policy scenarios. Generating a synthetic population is the first step in the application of any activity-based model system and has therefore been a topic of extensive research in the activity-based modeling arena. Several researchers have developed population synthesizers that can generate synthetic populations and can match household- and person-level constraints at a specified geographic resolution (e.g., a census block group). However, although information for some control variables may be available at the specified spatial resolution, information for other control variables may be available only at a more aggregate spatial resolution. Ignoring control variables at different levels of spatial resolution could result in the generation of a synthetic population that would not be representative of the underlying population. However, there has been limited progress in the development of synthetic population generators that are capable of accommodating control variables at multiple spatial resolutions. This paper proposes a robust approach to control for constraints at multiple geographic resolutions when generating a synthetic population. The method is an extension of the iterative proportional updating algorithm previously proposed and implemented by the authors. A case study demonstrating the efficacy of the enhanced algorithm is presented.},

The method involves a two-step approach. The first consists of a procedure based on Gibbs sampling, which has only recently been applied to population generation in transportation modeling and is generically called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For this work, the model was generalized, and an extension was developed, hierarchical MCMC, which was able to generate a hierarchical structure. The second step, a postprocessing step, uses generalized raking (GR), which reweights the output from hierarchical MCMC to perfectly satisfy known marginal control totals on the individual and household levels. The application input data-a demographic sample and some known marginals from Singapore-added further complexities to the problem, which had not yet been explored in the current literature.

The performance of urban simulation models is largely dependent on the quality of the input data, which is generated through a population synthesis procedure. This study proposes a Bayesian network and generalized raking techniques for population synthesis. The Bayesian network is used to generate the synthetic population pool from the microsample, and generalized raking is used to fit the synthetic population with the control total. Some of the key features of the proposed population synthesis are as follows: accommodating heterogeneity based on both household and individual attributes; tackling missing/incomplete observations in the microsample; and generating a true synthesis of the population from the microsamples. A data-driven structure learning technique is adopted to generate effective and optimal structures among the heterogenous households and individuals. This Bayesian network + generalized raking procedure is implemented to generate a 100\% synthetic population at the smallest zonal level of dissemination area for the Central Okanagan region of British Columbia. The results suggest that capturing heterogeneity within the Bayesian network has tremendously benefitted the reconstruction process to efficiently and accurately generate a synthetic population from the available microsample. Finally, this population synthesis is developed as a component of the agent-based integrated urban model, currently under development at The University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Activity-based travel demand modeling requires socioeconomic microdata of the population under study. Because the acquisition of such data for the entire population is infeasible or highly expensive, techniques such as iterative proportional fitting (IPF) have been applied extensively to estimate such data for the population, synthetically. Despite its many advantages, IPF results in noninteger values instead of integers: fractions of households or individuals are obtained for zones. Although methods have been proposed to produce integers for noninteger tables, seldom has this problem been viewed as tabular rounding. This paper proposes a binary linear programming model for tabular rounding in which the integer-converted table totals and marginal sums perfectly fit the input data obtained from the Census Bureau. Furthermore, the model minimizes distortion to the correlation structure of the household- and individual-level noninteger tables. The model does not bias the joint or marginal distributions of the socioeconomic attributes of population units or the sampling of rare demographic groups (at a significance level of α = .05). The empirical comparison of the proposed method with eight existing methods demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms the tested methods. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the integer conversion of small values is as significant as it is for large values. In this study, deterministic methods outperform stochastic methods in accuracy and perfect fit to census data. Finally, a scoring and ranking tool is used to reflect concisely the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.},

	abstract = {The advent of microsimulation in the transportation sector has created the need for extensive disaggregated data concerning the population whose behavior is modeled. Because of the cost of collecting this data and the existing privacy regulations, this need is often met by the creation of a synthetic population on the basis of aggregate data. Although several techniques for generating such a population are known, they suffer from a number of limitations. The first is the need for a sample of the population for which fully disaggregated data must be collected, although such samples may not exist or may not be financially feasible. The second limiting assumption is that the aggregate data used must be consistent, a situation that is most unusual because these data often come from different sources and are collected, possibly at different moments, using different protocols. The paper presents a new synthetic population generator in the class of the Synthetic Reconstruction methods, whose objective is to obviate these limitations. It proceeds in three main successive steps: generation of individuals, generation of household type's joint distributions, and generation of households by gathering individuals. The main idea in these generation steps is to use data at the most disaggregated level possible to define joint distributions, from which individuals and households are randomly drawn. The method also makes explicit use of both continuous and discrete optimization and uses the χ2 metric to estimate distances between estimated and generated distributions. The new generator is applied for constructing a synthetic population of approximately 10,000,000 individuals and 4,350,000 households localized in the 589 municipalities of Belgium. The statistical quality of the generated population is discussed using criteria extracted from the literature, and it is shown that the new population generator produces excellent results. © 2013 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Recently, disaggregate modeling efforts that rely on microdata have received wide attention by scholars and practitioners. Synthetic population techniques have been devised and are used as a viable alternative to the collection of microdata that normally are inaccessible because of confidentiality concerns or incomplete because of high acquisition costs. The two most widely discussed synthetic techniques are the synthetic reconstruction method (IPFSR), which makes use of iterative proportional fitting (IPF) techniques, and the combinatorial optimization (CO) method. Both methods are described in this article and then evaluated in terms of their ability to recreate a known population of firms, using limited data extracted from the parent population of the firms. Testing a synthetic population against a known population is seldom done, because obtaining an entire population usually is too difficult. The case presented here uses a small, complete population of firms for the City of Hamilton, Ontario, for the year 1990; firm attributes compiled are number of employees, 3-digit standard industrial classification, and geographic location. Results are summarized for experiments based upon various combinations of sample size and tabulation detail designed to maximize the accuracy of resulting synthetic populations while holding input data costs to a minimum. The output from both methods indicates that increases in sample size and tabulation detail result in higher quality synthetic populations, although the quality of the generated population is more sensitive to increases in tabular detail. Finally, most tests conducted with the created synthetic populations suggest that the CO method is superior to the IPFSR method. © 2009 by The Ohio State University.},

	abstract = {The application of disaggregate models for predictions and policy evaluations requires as inputs detailed information on the socioeconomic characteristics of the population. The early procedure developed for population synthesis involved the generation of a joint multiway distribution of all attributes of interest using iterative proportional fitting (IPF). Recognizing its limitations, including the inability to deal with multilevel controls, several alternate methods have been proposed in the last few years. This article presents a methodology called the fitness-based synthesis (FBS) that directly generates a list of households to match several multilevel controls without the need for determining a joint multiway distribution. The application and validation results demonstrate both the feasibility of the approach and its improved performance relative to the IPF and methods using fewer control tables. This article also presents a comprehensive validation of the synthetic populations against the true populations and thereby demonstrates the ability of the FBS method to generate the multidimensional correlations among the attributes. The number of iterations to terminations is found to be between one and three times the number of households to be synthesized. In sum, the FBS is an efficient and scalable methodology that is easy to implement and as such is a valuable tool for generating the detailed socioeconomic characteristics need for applying disaggregate travel-demand forecasting models.},

A precise reproduction of initial states is extremely important to obtain reliable forecast from the model. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an algorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by their age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical constraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head, difference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a population is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent) individual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often very important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic evolution. Usual techniques from microsimulation approach cross different sources of aggregated data for generating individuals. In our case the number of combinations of different households (types, sizes, age of participants) makes it computationally difficult to use directly such methods. Hence we developed a specific algorithm to make the problem more easily tractable. Conclusions/Significance: We generate the populations of two pilot municipalities in Auvergne region (France) to illustrate the approach. The generated populations show a good agreement with the available statistical datasets (not used for the generation) and are obtained in a reasonable computational time. © 2010 Gargiulo et al.},

However, most current literatures on population synthesis, which is the fundamental building block of disaggregated travel demand forecasting and agent-based traffic simulation, only considers the household impact. This paper makes two contributions in this regard. First, a methodological issue is identified: the existence of multiple social relationships (e.g., a dual set of constraints from social institutions or structures) makes it more difficult to generate a consistent synthetic population, meaning that this population satisfies constraints from more than one type of social organizations. A tensor decomposition method is then proposed to generate a consistent population with multi-social relationships. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of methodological issue has been addressed. Our sample-based method constitutes an improvement compared to existing approaches in that it can respect constraints from multiple social organizations without reducing accuracy. A numerical test concerning individual, household, and enterprise, using Chinese national population and economic census data, indicates that the new method can lead to stable and relatively small errors in total.

Empirical examples help to illustrate the relative utility of these tests for a range of purposes.},

Integrating data from different sources has become increasingly challenged as available datasets, and the relevant urban modeling efforts, become more disaggregated and spatial-temporally detailed. Open data initiatives, with unprecedented amounts of embedded georeferenced information, have made web services and crowdsourcing attractive. However, data from such sources are typically imperfect and their integration is complicated by syntactic and semantic differences. We develop an ontology-based data integration mechanism to fuse data from different sources in generic ways that can utilize semantic information to minimize the labor involved and facilitate updating as new data are acquired. As a test application, we evaluate, filter, adjust, and integrate building information from heterogeneous data sources for use in an agent-based microsimulation model of transportation and land-use dynamics in Singapore. Third-party data about building size, age and use added substantial value to the official datasets generally available from government agencies.},

	abstract = {Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are being increasingly used to evaluate urban systems, urban policies and environmental impacts. One prerequisite for using the ABM framework consists of generating a synthetic population representative of the actual population, featuring the appropriate attributes with respect to model objectives. A precise spatial positioning of the synthetic population agents is often key to ensuring ABM modeling quality. This paper considers the problem of allocating synthetic population agents to a finer spatial scale. Such an allocation process is performed from a higher-level statistical area where a synthetic population can be generated, that is, a container statistical area (CSA), to several nested non-overlapping elementary statistical areas (ESAs), where only marginals are available. This allocation step relies not only on common attributes between CSA and ESA, but also on additional discriminatory attributes, that is, attributes of interest, estimated from external data sources. The case study examined herein is based on French census and fiscal data. Common attributes include eight socio-demographic variables, totaling 17 modalities. An additional attribute of interest, that is, income, has also been added. The allocation problem at hand is modeled as an integer quadratic programming problem. An exact algorithm is first applied to solve the problem; the applicability of this algorithm proves to be limited to small-size synthetic populations. A heuristic is proposed to handle the allocation of larger-size synthetic populations. Tests carried out on the case study show that this heuristic yields near-optimal solutions; it is also computationally efficient and may fulfill the needs of a majority of users.},

Data limitations and privacy reasons often restrict the scope and detail with which a synthetic population can be generated by the traditional population synthesis approach. For the accommodation of the growing requirement of microsimulation on spatial resolution and variety, considering new data sources that overcome the data limitations and support population synthesis at more disaggregated levels is necessary. This paper presents a two-stage population synthesis approach not only to improve the accuracy of population generation with imperfect microdata and marginal data, but also to use additional data sets when the spatial details of the synthetic population are interpolated. A general iterative proportional fitting (IPF) method is used in the first stage to estimate the joint distribution of household and individual characteristics under multiple levels of constraints. Additional building information is collected from multiple sources und used to estimate spatial patterns of housing and household characteristics that are then preserved through a second IPF procedure. Preliminary tests of the proposed two-stage IPF-based approach with Singapore data show that the method yields better fitted population realizations at more fine-grained levels than do traditional one-step population synthesis methods.},

Although different software dedicated to the simulation of disaggregate travel demand have emerged, the amount of needed input data, in particular the characteristics of a synthetic population, is large and not commonly available, due to legit privacy concerns. In this paper, a methodology to spatially assign a synthetic population by exploiting only publicly available aggregate data is proposed, providing a systematic approach for an efficient treatment of the data needed for activity-based demand generation. The assignment of workplaces exploits aggregate statistics for economic activities and land use classifications to properly frame origins and destination dynamics. The methodology is validated in a case study for the city of Tallinn, Estonia, and the results show that, even with very limited data, the assignment produces reliable results up to a 500 × 500 m resolution, with an error at district level generally around 5\%. Both the tools needed for spatial assignment and the resulting dataset are available as open source, so that they may be exploited by fellow researchers.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) of urban systems have grown in popularity and complexity due to the widespread availability of high-performance computing resources and large data storage capabilities. Credible synthetic populations are crucial for the application of ABMs to understand urban phenomena. Although several (agent) population synthesis methods have been suggested over the years, the spatial dimension of synthetic populations has not received as much attention. This study addresses this myopic treatment of synthetic populations by creating two distinct components – agents and the built environment – that are integrated to form a ‘full’ spatially-detailed synthetic population. To generate agents, we used multiple Bayesian Networks (BN) to probabilistically draw pools from the microsample, followed by a Generalized Raking (GR) adjustment to match marginal controls. Using various measures, we demonstrate that our BN + GR framework outperforms more commonly used synthesis methods in both capturing the heterogeneity in the microsample and matching marginal controls. We also highlight the importance of accounting for heterogeneity by using separate type-specific models based on an explicitly defined household typology. For built environment synthesis, we generated various spatial entities such as buildings, housing units, establishments, and jobs at distinct spatial locations by fusing data from various spatial datasets. Their spatial distributions are found to effectively approximate the ‘real’ built environment in our study area. Our proposed framework can be used to generate a ‘full’ synthetic population for use in ABMs with more spatio-demographic heterogeneity than can otherwise be estimated using traditional methods.},

Our method is completely open and replicable, requiring only publicly available data to generate a synthetic population of agents compatible with commonly used agent-based modeling software such as MATSim.

Introductory literature about creating synthetic spatial microdata and discussions on the decisions that need to be taken during the data generation process are rare.

We describe four existing methods of integerisation and present a new one. Our method - 'truncate, replicate, sample' (TRS) - recognises that IPF weights consist of both 'replication weights' and 'conventional weights', the effects of which need to be separated. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) separate replication and conventional weights by truncation; (2) replication of individuals with positive integer weights; and (3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible using supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS is fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Most existing procedures used for the synthesis of population data are based on the iterative proportional fitting method, in which the number of individuals in each cell of the cross-classification table is estimated. Such a procedure is referred to as the cell-based approach in this study. The approach is based on predefined categories of individuals. Originally, however, these individuals have continuous attributes. Therefore, a different type of categorization would yield a different classification table, which would change the end results of the analysis. In this paper, this phenomenon is referred to as the modifiable attribute cell problem (MACP). It is similar to the modifiable area unit problem that arises when spatial data are aggregated into zones. This paper addresses MACP and proposes a method to determine the best combination of the categories. The solution of MACP is considered to be the minimization of the number of cells in a table with respect to the key output variable that has been defined and used as an evaluation criterion. Because of the computational difficulty resulting from the combination explosion, symbiotic evolution, which is a kind of genetic algorithm, is used.

	abstract = {A proportional shares model of daily time allocation is developed and applied to the analysis of joint activity participation between adult household members. The model is unique in its simultaneous representation of each decision maker’s decisions concerning independent activity participation, allocation of time to joint activities, and the interplay between individual and joint activities. Further, the model structure ensures that predicted shares of joint activity outcomes be the same for both decision makers, an improvement over models that do not make interpersonal linkages explicit. The empirical analysis of travel diary data shows that employment commitments and childcare responsibilities have significant effects on tradeoffs between joint and independent activities. In addition, evidence is presented for the continued relevance of gender-based role differences in caring for children and employment participation.},

	abstract = {Operational models of the household activity-scheduling process have emerged recently. These models replicate the sequence of decisions that leads to observed patterns of human activities and travel, including which activities to conduct, with whom, for how long, at what time and location, and by what mode. Activity priority has been suggested as an important dimension in such scheduling models, particularly as a determinant for the choice and sequencing of activities. The importance of intrahousehold interactions, joint activities in particular, has led to a rapid expansion of research on this topic. However, within most scheduling models, joint activities have been addressed, at best, by assuming that they are preplanned relative to independent activities. Within this context, two important issues concerning the planning of joint activities are explored: the extent to which joint activities are preplanned and whether male and female householders share the same priority when scheduling joint activities. The data set used for the study was the 2003 Computerized Household Activity Scheduling Elicitor survey for Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which recorded information about when a particular activity was planned by respondents. In the analysis, bivariate probit models are estimated for two scheduling alternatives (impulsive or preplanned) for husband and wife. Overall, the empirical results highlight the need to move beyond static priority assumptions for determining the sequencing of activities to develop a behaviorally sound model for activity scheduling. Furthermore, differences in planning priority across individual participants should be taken into account.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, many activity-based travel behaviour models have been proposed based on individuals’ independent decision making. The modelling of individuals’ joint activity/travel choices, however, has received less attention. In reality, both independent and joint activities/travels form individual’s normal daily activity-travel patterns. Travel surveys have indicated that joint activity/travel constitutes an important part in individuals’ daily activity-travel patterns. On this basis, explicit modelling of joint activity/travel choices is an essential component for long-term transport planning. In this study, an activity-based network equilibrium model is proposed for scheduling two-individual joint activity-travel patterns (JATPs) in congested multi-modal transit networks. The proposed model can be used to comprehensively investigate individuals’ activity choices (e.g. activity start time and duration, activity sequence) and travel choices (e.g. departure time, route and mode) in multi-modal transit networks, including both independent ones and joint ones. The time-dependent JATP choice problem is converted into an equivalent static user equilibrium model by constructing a joint-activity-time-space (JATS) super-network platform. Joint travel beneﬁt is modelled by incorporating a commonality factor in the JATP utility. A solution algorithm without prior JATP enumeration is proposed to solve the JATP scheduling problem on the JATS super-network. Numerical results show that individuals’ independent and joint activity/travel choices can be simultaneously investigated by the proposed model. The impacts of joint travel beneﬁt on individuals’ independent and joint activity-travel choices are explicitly investigated.},

	abstract = {Intra-household interactions constitute an important aspect in modeling activity and travel-related decisions. Recognition of this importance has recently produced a growing body of research on various aspects of modeling intra-household interactions and group decision-making mechanisms as well as ﬁrst attempts to incorporate intra-household interactions in regional travel demand models. The previously published research works were mostly focused on time allocation aspect and less on generation of activity episodes, trips, and travel tours that are necessary units for compatibility with regional travel demand models. Also, most of the approaches were limited to household heads only and did not consider explicitly the other household members as acting agents in the intra-household decision making. A model is proposed for joint choice of daily activity pattern (DAP) types for all household members that explicitly takes into account added group-wise utilities of joint participation in the same activity. The model is based on the aggregate description of individual DAP types by three main categories – mandatory travel pattern, non-mandatory travel pattern, and at-home pattern. Important intra-household interactions can be captured already at this aggregate level. A choice structure considers all possible combinations of DAPs of all household members as alternatives. Utility function of each alternative includes components corresponding to each individual DAP type as well as group-wise interaction terms that correspond to joint choice of the same pattern by several household members. Statistical analysis of intra-household interactions and estimation results of the choice model are presented. The model estimation has conﬁrmed a strong added utility of joint choice of the same pattern for such person types as non-worker or part time worker in combination with child, two retired persons, two children, and others. The proposed model represents a part of the advanced regional model system being developed for the Atlanta Regional Commission.},

The behavioural realism of travel demand models that explicitly accommodate intra-household interactions is expected to provide more insight into travel behaviour and a more credible analysis of travellers’ response to transport policy than models that deal with household interactions in a ‘black box’. This paper reviews the literature on group decisions and intra-household interactions. How intra-household interactions inﬂuence the way in which decisions are made is expounded and empirical ﬁndings are drawn upon to argue for why the study of intra-household interactions is important. Various analytical techniques and data requirements are discussed to show how intra-household interactions can be handled. Drawing on this review, the impact of intra-household interactions on travel behaviour and implications for transport policy are identiﬁed and directions for further study suggested.},

	abstract = {Residential self-selection has been acknowledged as a key issue underlining the link between the built environment and travel behavior. Existing studies often implicitly assume that residential choice is a decision of an individual and the influence of intra-household interactions is not considered. In reality, residential choice is a decision often made at the household-level involving more than one household members. Similarly, car ownership is usually a household-level decision incorporating views of different household members. In both cases, the travel related attitudes of more than one household members may play a role in the decision making. In other words, there is an issue concerning residential self-selection (similarly car ownership self-selection): whose self-selection? This paper makes an attempt to probe into this question by examining the self-selection issues concerning residential location choice and car ownership decision from the perspective of households, by incorporating the travel attitudes and travel behaviors of two household heads into an integrated self-selection framework. Data are derived from a household sample survey involving two-day activity-travel diaries conducted in 2016 in Beijing, China. Multivariate modeling results show that household members play different roles in household decisions with travel implications: in general husbands’ travel attitudes have relatively more influence in residential choice and car ownership decision than wives’. Nevertheless, wives’ travel attitudes have more power than husbands’ in explaining the commuting distances of both husbands and wives. Some distinct features of the residential and car ownership self-selections in the Chinese context are also identified and discussed in this paper.},

However, the existing activity-based models are mostly based on the individual decision-making process, which are limited in their demonstration of behaviour. We simulate multiple intra-household interaction dimensions within the same framework and capture the coordination of the activity scheduling decisions among all household members. Our approach adopts the Optimisation-based Activity Scheduling Integrating Simultaneous choice dimensions (OASIS) framework, which is at the level of isolated individuals and focuses on out-ofhome activity schedules. We jointly simulate in- and out-of-home activities and incorporate interactions into the framework. Our framework contributes to the state-of-the-art in activitybased modelling by explicitly capturing multiple interactions within the same model, such as the allocation of the private vehicle to household members, dividing household maintenance responsibilities, escorting, joint activity participation, and sharing rides. We operationalise the model using time-use-survey data from the United Kingdom. The simulation results demonstrate the ability of the framework to capture complex intra-household interactions. We then demonstrate how these interactions can cause individuals to deviate from their schedules planned in isolation. This is a general framework applicable to different household compositions and available resources.},

In doing this, this study introduces a model structure that represents the complex interactions between the parents’ travel patterns, their perceptions on public transport services and their reported residential self-selectivity reasons and the children travel mode shares. This structure is analysed with structural equation modelling. The model estimation results show that parents’ residential self-selectivity, parents’ perceptions and satisfactions on accessibilities and their daily travel patterns signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the children’s daily travel mode shares. However, the effects are not uniform across household members. This study has revealed that households’ residential self-selectivity behaviours have more correlations with the children’s non-motorised mode shares, whilst the parents’ perceptions and satisfactions on transport infrastructure and public transport service qualities have more correlations with parents’ mode shares. The results also conﬁrm that parents’ nonmotorised modes use in travelling is highly correlated with the children’s physically active travel mode shares. However, at the same time, the results also show that the effects of mothers’ car use to the children travel mode shares is more apparent than fathers’.},

The school trip information of 1737 two-parent families with a student is extracted from Travel Behavior Inventory data collected by the Metropolitan Council between the Fall 2010 and Spring 2012. The model has four distinct characteristics including: (1) considering the student explicitly in the model, (2) allowing for bargaining or negotiation within households, (3) quantifying the intra-household interaction among family members, and (4) determining the decision weight function for household members. This framework also covers a household with three members, namely, a father, a mother, and a student, and unlike other studies it is not limited to dual-worker families. To test the hypotheses we build two models, each with and without the group-decision approach. The models are separately built for different age groups, namely students 6–12 and 12–18 years old. This study considers a wide range of variables such as work status of parents, age and gender of students, mode of travel, and distance to school. The ﬁndings of this study demonstrate that the elasticities of the two modeling approaches differ not only in the value, but in the sign in some cases. In 63\% of the cases the unitary household model underestimates the results. More precisely, the elasticities of the unitary household model are as much as 2 times more than that of the group-decision model in 20\% of cases. This is a direct consequence of model misspeciﬁcation that misleads both long- and short-term policies where the intra-household bargaining and interaction is overlooked in travel behavior models.},

	abstract = {Background: Children's active transport (AT) is a potential source of habitual physical activity with established health benefits. We aimed to examine built environment and household travel characteristics as predictors of AT to school and total daily duration of physical activity accumulated via AT.
Methods: Cross-sectional household travel survey data from 713 households with children aged 5–12 years (n = 1024) residing {\textless} 2 km from school (i.e. walking distance) across Melbourne, Australia (2012–16) were combined with objectively-measured distance to school and walkability (based on intersection density, housing density, land use mix) around home and school. Multilevel multivariable modified-Poisson regression analyses examined built environment variables (distance to school, walkability, traffic) and household travel behaviours (children's and adults’ trip chaining, adult accompaniment to school) as predictors of: (1) AT to school; (2) total daily duration of AT of ≥ 20 min; adjusted for spatial clustering (at SA1 level) and household variables (income, employment, cars, bicycles).
Results: Most children (80\%) had adult accompaniment to school but only 28\% walked/cycled with an adult. Overall, 39\% of children used AT to school and 24\% accrued ≥ 20 min of ATrelated physical activity. AT to school was positively associated with higher (rather than lower) walkability around home and school, direct travel (not trip chaining) and residing close to school ({\textless} 0.75 km rather than ≥ 1.25 km), and negatively associated with adult accompaniment and longer distance travelled onward in adult trip chains. AT of ≥ 20 min duration daily was positively associated with higher walkability around school, direct travel to/from school; and negatively associated with adult accompaniment to, and distance trip chained onward from, school.
Conclusions: To increase AT to school it is worth investing in infrastructure designed to improve walkability around schools, coupled with campaigns that target whole households to promote age-appropriate independent mobility rather than adult accompaniment, which tends to involve children being driven.},
